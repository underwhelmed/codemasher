CodeMasher is a simple rails 3 application that lets attendees of the conference, CodeMash, look for random sessions 
if they don't know which one to attend.  It's very lightweight so it can be used from mobile phones and using the 
CodeMash WIFI (since we all know what that's like).

Codemasher uses the CodeMash REST API: http://codemash.org/rest

Until the full schedule is released, the application will return any session at random.  Once the schedule has been
integrated into the REST API, the application will return based on more criteria, such as NEXT AVAILABLE SESSIONS, 
CURRENT SESSIONS and possibly a filter on technology, track, difficulty or searching all text fields.
