CodeMasher is a simple rails 3 application that lets attendees of the conference, CodeMash, look for random sessions 
if they don't know which one to attend.  It's very lightweight so it can be used from mobile phones and using the 
CodeMash WIFI (since we all know what that's like).

Codemasher uses the CodeMash REST API: http://codemash.org/rest
